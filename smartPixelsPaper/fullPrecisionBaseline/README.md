## data reduction
- https://github.com/jieunyoo/directional-pixel-detectors/blob/main/smartPixelsPaper/fullPrecisionBaseline/evaluateFP_onUntracked.ipynb-
- DS 14: https://github.com/jieunyoo/directional-pixel-detectors/blob/main/smartPixelsPaper/fullPrecisionBaseline/DS14-predictions.ipynb
- but note that DS 14 doesn't go above 2 GeV, so a correction was applied
