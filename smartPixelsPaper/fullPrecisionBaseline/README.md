## dataset 8, sig eff. and bkg rejection
- dataset 8 had to be reweighted

- https://github.com/jieunyoo/directional-pixel-detectors/blob/main/smartPixelsPaper/fullPrecisionBaseline/BkgRej_Reweighted.ipynb

## data reduction
#### datasets
- as of this time, DS 14 (tracked), and DS15 (untracked) were used for metrics
  
#### files
- https://github.com/jieunyoo/directional-pixel-detectors/blob/main/smartPixelsPaper/fullPrecisionBaseline/evaluateFP_onUntracked.ipynb
- DS 14: https://github.com/jieunyoo/directional-pixel-detectors/blob/main/smartPixelsPaper/fullPrecisionBaseline/DS14-predictions.ipynb
- but note that DS 14 doesn't go above 2 GeV, so a correction was applied
